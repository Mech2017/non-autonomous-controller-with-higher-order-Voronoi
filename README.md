# non-autonomous-controller-with-higher-order-Voronoi
This program provides simulation results of the non-autonomous controller for multi-agent systems based on second-order Voronoi partition. 

To reproduce the simulation results, you can run the hov_control.m, which already incorporates the code for generating a 2D closed region, drawing a Voronoi diagram, distributing mobile agents and moving targets, defining sensing function, coverage metric and non-autonomous control law.

The program for drawing the Voronoi diagram is written by Hyongju Park and imported from MathWorks at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52477-polytope-bounded-order-2-voronoi-diagram-in-2d-3d

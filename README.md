# non-autonomous-controller-with-higher-order-Voronoi
This progam provides simulation results of non-autonomous controller for multi-agent systems based on second-order Voronoi partition.
To reproduce the simulation results, you can simply run the hov_control.m
The program for drawing Voronoi diagram is written by Hyongju Park, and imported from MathWorks at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/52477-polytope-bounded-order-2-voronoi-diagram-in-2d-3d
